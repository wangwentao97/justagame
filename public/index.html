    <h2>How Many Points Can You Get?</h2>
    <div class="instruction">
        <p>This is a game based on game theory.</p>
        <p>Game theory studies interactive decision-making, where the outcome for each participant depends on the actions of all.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are several questions in this game.</li>
            <li>Each question has some options.</li>
            <li>You will earn or lose points by choosing the options.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>*Remember: the points you earn or lose are also affected by others' decision. When choosing your "strategy", you should take into account the choices of others.</p>
        <p>Good Luck.</p>
